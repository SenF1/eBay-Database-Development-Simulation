# eBay-Database-Development-Simulation

A simulation of eBay’s database development, a leading global e-commerce platform with millions of buyers and sellers.

## Project Description

A database design and development assignment for the course Database Design and Development (67-262) at Carnegie Mellon University. The purpose of this project is to explore the database development life cycle by replicating part of eBay’s foundational work. 

The new website aims to help customers learn more about the menu items, promotions, gift cards, location and contact information of the factory. It also provides a simplified but enhanced experience for visitors to navigate the website, search for menu items, and link to third-party sites to order food from the menu.

The project uses Postgres as the relational database management system, SQL as the query language, and Psycopg2 as the Python library that connects the database and the user interface. It followed the requirements and specifications provided by the course instructor. The project did not intend to replicate the full scale and complexity of eBay’s actual database.
